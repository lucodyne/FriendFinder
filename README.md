Friend Finder is an app that mimics a matchmaking site LOL. Answer 10 questions, and it'll pair you with someone who answered similarly!

## How it works

Logic is pretty straightforward. The first entry doesn't get a match, but every user afterwards is told the name of an existing entry that had the lowest sum of differences of all their survey answers.
